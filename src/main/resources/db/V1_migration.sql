VALUES (1, 'Napoleon I Bonaparte was a French commander and statesman. Emperor of France (1804-1814 and in March -June 1815). In 1799, he committed a coup d''etat and became the first consul; ' ||
           'in 1804 he was proclaimed emperor. He significantly expanded the territory of the empire and made most of the countries of Western and Central Europe dependent on France. In 1814, he abdicated the throne. ' ||
           'He regained the throne in 1815. After the defeat at Waterloo (June 1815), he was exiled to St. Helena.Napoleon Buonaparte (Bonaparte) was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio, in the family of lawyer Carlo Buonaparte, who came from a small-scale Corsican nobility, and Letizia Ramolino, who belonged to an ancient patrician family. ' ||
           'Carlo Buonaparte, who survived eight of his twelve children, was rewarded for his loyalty to France with the opportunity to send his eldest sons, Joseph and Napoleon, to college in 1779. Two months later, Napoleon transferred to the military school in Brienne. In 1784, having received the rank of cadet, he continued his studies at the military school in Paris. ' ||
           'A year later, Napoleon was promoted to lieutenant of artillery and sent to the prestigious La Fere regiment. Bonaparte served in Valence and Auxonne. His performance was phenomenal: he needed no more than 4-5 hours of sleep a day. ' ||
           'He read a lot and continued to educate himself. During the French Revolution (1789-1794), Napoleon sided with the Girondists.'),
        (2, 'Aristotle is rightfully considered the greatest encyclopedist of antiquity and the most significant systematizer of philosophical and scientific knowledge accumulated before him. He is also known as the tutor of the great commander Alexander the Great. ' ||
            'Appreciating Plato highly, he criticized his teaching, uttering the catch phrase: "Plato is my friend, but the truth is dearer." Developing his views on being, Aristotle criticizes Plato''s teaching about the existence of ideas as completely independent pre-natural entities. ' ||
            'In his opinion, such ideas represent only concepts reflecting the material world, i.e. they are like copies of things, but not the other way around. Aristotle formulates his idea of being perceived through sensations. This objective, sensual world is the primary reality, nature, ' ||
            'which is not defined by anyone.Matter is the universal cause, because without it there is no existence, Aristotle believes. The shape plays the role of a feature. Thanks to it, matter is realized and a specific object is formed. In other words, the form is represented as the sum of the properties that distinguish' ||
            ' one object from another, and is the essence of both the object and being as a whole. Thanks to the form, the thing is what it really is.The human soul, as well as its essence or body shape, gives meaning and direction to life. "The soul is the cause and the beginning of a living body..." As form dominates matter, so, ' ||
            'accordingly, the soul dominates the body, the mind dominates the senses. There are 3 types of soul: vegetable soul, which plants possess; sensual, which animals are endowed with; intelligent, inherent in man.Aristotle''s theory of knowledge is based on the position of empiricism, according to which the essence of things is known through sensations.' ||
            ' And although sensations give us knowledge only of the individual, they potentially contain knowledge of the general, which is known by science. Philosophy is being built over science, which coincides in many ways with logic. Logic helps to separate the general from the particular, truth from false knowledge. Aristotle called the method of identifying the common, ' ||
            'with which one can then explain individual factors, induction. He called the method of proof from syllogisms, i.e. from general conclusions, deduction.A significant place in Aristotle''s philosophy is occupied by man and the problems of social life. Man, in his opinion, is a "political animal", which has an instinctive tendency towards "cohabitation". "The one who cannot enter and form part of a certain community, ' ||
            'who does not need anyone or anything, is sufficient for himself, then, not being part of the state, he is either a beast or a God."The purpose of the State is to ensure the happiness of all citizens, which include only those who own property and participate in the management of society. Slaves were not citizens.Aristotle distinguished 6 forms of the state: 3 correct: aristocracy, monarchy and polity, and 3 incorrect: tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. ' ||
            'The best form is politics, as it combines the properties of a moderate democracy and the personal dignity of an oligarchy inherent in noble people.'),
        (3, 'Chekhov''s humor can be called ruthless and even unscrupulous. Remember, for example, the story "Death of an official", the hero of which sneezed at the general and was so worried about it that he died. Such black humor is often explained by the fact that Chekhov was a doctor by profession, and representatives of this profession are not considered to be too sensitive. ' ||
            'This is confirmed by another doctor from Russian literature, Mikhail Bulgakov, who is also known for his inimitable irony and ruthlessness towards human vices.Chekhov laughs at something that is not accepted and even indecent to laugh at today. He constantly violates the reader''s boundaries. In modern society, they carefully touch on such things as stupidity or lack of will, ' ||
            'considering them subjective and abstract. But Chekhov is not confused by this. His characters get into awkward situations, and sometimes even experience tragedy precisely because of their weakness of character or their narrow-mindedness. He wrote: "It''s not about pessimism or optimism, but the fact that 99 out of 100 have no mind."According to Chekhov, "the art of writing is the art of shortening," ' ||
            'but brevity does not equal simplicity. To express a complex idea succinctly and accurately, the author needs not only scissors, with which he cuts everything superfluous, but also other tools. Therefore, in humorous prose, Chekhov resorts to various artistic techniques, both innovative and recognizable. For example, the famous "Thick and Thin" from the school literature list is based on an almost fable allegory. ' ||
            'In "Chameleon" there is a transparent satire on worship. And in the story "The Horse''s Name", the writer attracts a linguistic game.But still, Chekhov is known to the whole world primarily as a playwright. Chekhov''s plays may seem rather sad — even if he himself calls them comedies. Sometimes it''s not clear where to laugh at all. "Whether to go for tea or hang yourself," this depressing statement of the writer can describe the atmosphere of his plays.'),
        (4, 'Why is Bulgakov''s famous novel called "The Master and Margarita", and what is this book really about? It is known that the idea of creation was born in the author after his fascination with mysticism of the XIX century.Legends about the devil, Jewish and Christian demonology, treatises on God – all this is present in the work. The most important sources consulted by the author were the works ' ||
            '"The History of Human relations with the Devil" by Mikhail Orlov and the book by Amfiteatrov "The Devil in everyday life, legend and literature of the Middle Ages". As you know, the "Master and Margarita" had several editions. They say that the first one, which the author worked on in 1928-1929, had nothing to do with either the Master or Margarita, and was called "The Black Magician", "The Juggler with the Hoof". ' ||
            'That is, the central figure and essence of the novel was precisely the Devil - a kind of Russian version of the work "Faust". Bulgakov personally burned the first manuscript after the prohibition of his play "The Cabal of the Saints." The writer informed the government about this: "And personally, with my own hands, I threw a draft of a novel about the devil into the stove!" The second edition was also dedicated to the ' ||
            'fallen angel and was called "Satan" or "The Great Chancellor". Margarita and the Master have already appeared here, and Woland has got his retinue. But, only the third manuscript received its current title, which, in fact, the author never finished. The last edition of the novel, which subsequently reached the reader, was started in 1937. The author continued to work with her until his death. ' ||
            'Why couldn''t he finish the book he had been writing for a dozen years? Did he think that he was insufficiently knowledgeable about the issue he was taking up, and his understanding of Jewish demonology and early Christian texts was amateurish? Anyway, the novel practically "sucked out" the author''s life. The last correction, which he made on February 13, 1940, was Margarita''s phrase: "So it means that the writers are following the coffin?". ' ||
            'He died a month later. Bulgakov''s last words addressed to Roman were: "So that they know, so that they know...".'),
        (5, 'The earliest people were more like animals than us, but thanks to the constant desire for new and hard work, they managed to survive, learned to take care of children, the sick, the weak, the elderly, found speech, religion, created art, settled in all parts of the world except Antarctica. Gradually, the number of people grew. From appropriating what they found in nature, primitive people moved on to producing the necessities of life, ' ||
            'and then from primitiveness to civilization.First of all, this transition took place in the Ancient East. Large states with unlimited royal power were formed there. Mankind owes a lot of achievements to the most ancient civilizations, among them: writing, laws, calendar. The development of iron has pushed the limits of the civilized world. A continuous belt of civilizations was formed from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.' ||
            'Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome developed differently from the states of the Ancient East. The ancient Greeks first created democracy, a form of government that ensures the participation of people in the governance of their country. The ancient Greeks made a huge contribution to the development of many sciences, literature and art.The Roman state was the largest state in the Ancient world. All the lands that were part of it, inhabited by many peoples, gradually adopted Roman culture.The history of Ancient ' ||
            'Rome has shown that no state, no matter how powerful it may be, can forever oppress conquered peoples. It was the people whom the Romans contemptuously called "barbarians" who crushed Rome. But the development of mankind has not stopped. The era of the Middle Ages has come.') on conflict do nothing;
